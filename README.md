Page 1: Overview and Purpose of the Repository

Introduction
The BankAcountRandomAPI provides a backend API for generating random bank account details. This type of service can be useful 
for software testing, demo environments, or educational purposes where realistic but non-sensitive financial data is needed.

General Structure of the src Directory
The src directory typically contains the core source code files responsible for the main logic of the API. In Node.js or similar backend projects, this directory 
is where youâ€™ll find controllers, models, utility functions, and route definitions.

Common File Types
Controllers: Handle incoming requests and coordinate responses.
Models: Define the structure of bank account data.
Routes: Map URLs to controller functions.
Utilities: Provide supporting functions (e.g., random data generation).
API Functionality
The API exposes endpoints to generate random bank account details. These details might include:

Account numbers (following realistic formats)
Bank names or codes
Account holder names
Branch information
The randomness must ensure no real customer data is used, but the format should be valid according to banking standards.

Main Components in src
Account Generator Logic

There is likely a core file responsible for generating bank account details. This file contains functions like generateAccountNumber(), 
getRandomBankName(), and generateAccountHolder().
These functions use randomization algorithms and possibly pre-defined lists (e.g., valid bank names, plausible branch codes).
API Route Definitions

The routes map HTTP requests (such as GET /api/random-account) to the generator logic.
Example route:
JavaScript
app.get('/api/random-account', accountController.generateRandomAccount);
The controller validates the request, calls the generator, and returns a JSON response.
Validation and Error Handling

To ensure generated data conforms to banking standards, validation logic checks the format of account numbers and other details.
Error handling ensures that any unexpected input or internal error results in a meaningful HTTP error code and message.
Testing and Extensibility

The codebase may include unit tests (in src/__tests__ or similar) to ensure each part of the generator works as expected.
The API can be extended to generate other types of financial data or integrate with frontend clients.
How to Use
For Testing: Integrate the API into your test automation to supply fake bank accounts.
For Demos: Use the endpoints to populate demo applications with realistic banking data.
Customization: Developers can modify the source code to adjust formats or add new fields.
Conclusion
The src folder is the heart of the BankAcountRandomAPI project, containing all logic needed to generate, validate, and serve random bank account data. By separating concerns into controllers, models, and utilities, the codebase remains organized, maintainable, and extensible. This approach allows developers to quickly understand, modify, and deploy the API for various use cases.
